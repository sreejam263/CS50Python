# CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains code developed for "[CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)" offered by Harvard OpenCourseWare. The course includes nine problem sets, each with 4-5 predefined tasks, and concludes with a final project. The following section outlines the topics covered in each problem set and provides details about the assignments. 

## Problem Set 0 - Functions, Variables

* [Indoor Voice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/indoor/) - prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespaces stay unchanged.
* [Playback Speed](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/playback/) - prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each ' '(whitespace) with '...'.
* [Making Face](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/faces/) - implements a function called `convert` that accepts a `str` as input and returns that same input with any `:)` converted to üôÇ (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any `:(` converted to üôÅ (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text is returned unchanged.
* [Einstein](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/einstein/) - prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. 
* [Tip Calculator](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/tip/) - implements two functions: `dollars_to_float` (accepts a `str` as input (formatted as `$##.##`, wherein each `#` is a decimal digit), and removes the leading `$`, and returns the amount as a `float`), and `percent_to_float` (accepts a `str` as input (formatted as `##%`, wherein each `#` is a decimal digit), removes the trailing `%`, and returns the percentage as a float).
