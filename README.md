# CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains code created for "[CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)" course by Harvard Open OpenCourseWare. The course consists of nine problem sets with 4-5 pre-defined tasks in each, and a final project. The following chapters describes the topic of each problem set and details assignments in it. 

## Problem Set 0 - Functions, Variables

* [Indoor Voice] - program prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespaces in the input stay unchanged.
* [Playback Speed] - program prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with '...'.
* [Making Face] - program implements a function called `convert` that accepts a `str` as input and returns that same input with any `:)` converted to üôÇ (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any `:(` converted to üôÅ (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text is returned unchanged.
* [Einstein] - program prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. 
* [Tip Calculator] - program implements two functions: `dollars_to_float`, which accepts a `str` as input (formatted as `$##.##`, wherein each `#` is a decimal digit), removes the leading `$`, and returns the amount as a `float`, and `percent_to_float`, which accepts a `str` as input (formatted as `##%`, wherein each `#` is a decimal digit), removes the trailing `%`, and returns the percentage as a float.
